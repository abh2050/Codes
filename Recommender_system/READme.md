# Healthcare Professional-Job Matching Project

This repository contains a Python project for matching healthcare professionals to job opportunities. It utilizes Pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, and includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and recommendation generation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- scikit-learn library
- NumPy library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   - Pandas: `pip install pandas`
   - scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
   - NumPy: `pip install numpy`

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing data from CSV files.
2. Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
3. Feature engineering for better matching.
4. Merging datasets and encoding categorical variables.
5. Creating a user-item matrix for recommendation.
6. Computing similarity matrices and generating job recommendations.

## Data Preparation

The project uses two datasets: `professionals.csv` and `jobs.csv`, representing healthcare professionals and job opportunities, respectively. These datasets are preprocessed to remove duplicates and handle missing values.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering techniques such as creating composite scores, clustering, and compatibility prediction are employed to enhance the matching process.

## Matching Process

1. Merge the `professionals` and `jobs` datasets on shared features.
2. Encode categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.
3. Create a user-item matrix representing the interaction between professionals and jobs.
4. Calculate similarity matrices using techniques like cosine similarity.
5. Generate job recommendations based on collaborative filtering.

## Usage

Run the Python script to process the data and output job recommendations. The script includes functions for recommending jobs based on similarity scores and retrieving job details for the recommended positions.

## Customization

You can customize the project by:
- Updating the datasets with real-world data.
- Modifying the feature engineering steps to suit specific matching criteria.
- Adjusting the recommendation algorithm parameters.
