# SERP Rank Prediction Model

This project includes a machine learning model to predict the rank of keywords in Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` contains the code for the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.


The SERP Rank Prediction Model project is designed to apply machine learning techniques to predict the ranking of keywords on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The motivation behind this project stems from the crucial role that SERP rankings play in Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Higher rankings typically correlate with higher visibility to users, which can significantly affect website traffic and, by extension, business success.

Businesses and SEO professionals are constantly seeking to understand the factors that influence these rankings. By leveraging data science, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights from historical SERP data that can inform and improve SEO strategies.

Key motivations for this project include:

- SEO Optimization: By predicting SERP rankings, businesses can better understand how to optimize their content and keywords to improve their visibility on search engines.

- Competitive Analysis: Understanding the factors that contribute to higher rankings can help businesses analyze their competition and adjust their SEO tactics accordingly.

- Algorithmic Insight: Search engine algorithms are complex and not fully transparent. This project seeks to provide a window into how certain content characteristics may affect rankings.

- Data-Driven Decision Making: By utilizing machine learning, the project moves SEO from a sometimes speculative endeavor to a more data-driven field, allowing for more strategic and informed decisions.

- Innovation in SEO: The project represents an innovative approach to a traditional domain, potentially leading to novel insights and advancements in SEO practices.

This project is about harnessing the power of data and machine learning to gain a competitive edge in the digital marketplace by better understanding and predicting the dynamics of SERP rankings.


## Overview

The goal of the model is to predict the rank of various SEO keywords based on features extracted from the meta descriptions and presence of featured snippets in SERPs. The dataset used for training contains historical SERP data, including ranks and text features.

## Contents of `main.ipynb`

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook begins with loading and cleaning the SERP data, followed by feature extraction, including TF-IDF vectorization of text data.
- **Model Training**: A Gradient Boosting Regressor is trained on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the metric.
- **Predictions**: The trained model is used to make predictions on test data.
- **Visualization**: It includes generating a scatter plot visualization to compare actual vs. predicted ranks.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure that all dependencies are installed, including `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and others as required by the notebook.
2. **Data**: Place your SERP data in a CSV file in the same directory as the notebook, or update the file paths in the code to point to your data location.
3. **Run**: Execute the cells in the notebook in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
