# SERP Rank Prediction Model

This project includes a machine learning model to predict the rank of keywords in Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` contains the code for the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Overview

The goal of the model is to predict the rank of various SEO keywords based on features extracted from the meta descriptions and presence of featured snippets in SERPs. The dataset used for training contains historical SERP data, including ranks and text features.

## Contents of `main.ipynb`

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook begins with loading and cleaning the SERP data, followed by feature extraction, including TF-IDF vectorization of text data.
- **Model Training**: A Gradient Boosting Regressor is trained on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the metric.
- **Predictions**: The trained model is used to make predictions on test data.
- **Visualization**: It includes generating a scatter plot visualization to compare actual vs. predicted ranks.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure that all dependencies are installed, including `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and others as required by the notebook.
2. **Data**: Place your SERP data in a CSV file in the same directory as the notebook, or update the file paths in the code to point to your data location.
3. **Run**: Execute the cells in the notebook in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
